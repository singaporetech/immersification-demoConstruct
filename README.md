# demoConstruct Open Source

## Introduction

As the name implies, we aim to democratize the construction of digital twin environments. The eventual artifact is a tool for users to collaborate on creating virtual scenes through any platform, for various purposes.

demoConstruct is an open-source initiative designed to democratize digital twin creation, serving as a branching platform to allow users to adapt and accommodate the source code for the development of digital twins tools in the context of their own use case. With demoConstruct, users aimming to create digital twin of existing physical locations and objects can collaboratively create digital replica with common consumer grade mobile device and computers, without needing to depend on deep specialized or technical knowledge.

**Capture and Reconstruction Client**

The capture client allows users to capture imagery which are continuously sent to the edge node to perform progressive reconstruction.

**Collaborative editing Client**

The editing client enables users to use progressively reconstructed 3D models to build digital twin environments that are kept current from incremental updates sent by the edge node..

**Edge Node and Server**

The edge node acts as the reconstruction provider and central repository to store data and sync model and editing changes.
